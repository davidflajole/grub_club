# GrubClub FoodCarts Context and Tests

Built on Elixir/Erlang:
  * Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.0.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns] [dtrace]
  * Elixir 1.15.6 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 26)

Steps to run tests:
  * Clone repo to working directory
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Run mix test to see tests are passing
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
    > verify that project runs and standard phoenix bootstrapped page loads in browser (http://localhost:4000) 


## Future Exploration

* Add a LiveView page to view and filter food carts
* Add a Phoenix API and create Postman calls
